## Umbrel Community App Store Template

This repository is a template to create an Umbrel Community App Store. These additional app stores allow developers to distribute applications without submitting to the [Official Umbrel App Store](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps).
This fork was created to add apps that I personally need, but it is available for everyone to use. Please note that updates are not guaranteed.

## Available Apps:
1. [deemix](https://gitlab.com/RemixDev/deemix-gui): A versatile and lightweight music downloader that allows users to easily download music tracks and albums. 


Other apps will be added as needed. I will probably add [SaturnMusic](https://github.com/SaturnMusic/) to replace deemix as soon as someone creates a Docker version of it.
