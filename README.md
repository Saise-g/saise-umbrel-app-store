## Saise's Umbrel Community App Store

This repository is a fork of the original Umbrel Community App Store template. These additional app stores allow developers to distribute applications without submitting to the [Official Umbrel App Store](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-apps).

This fork was specifically created to add applications that I personally need for my own use. However, it is openly available for anyone to use. Feel free use the apps as you like.

Please note that updates to these applications are not guaranteed, as they are primarily maintained based on my personal requirements.

## Available Apps:
1. [deemix](https://gitlab.com/RemixDev/deemix-gui): A versatile and lightweight music downloader that allows users to easily download music tracks and albums. 

Other apps will come when I need them. I'll probably add [SaturnMusic](https://github.com/SaturnMusic/) to replace deemix as soon as someone makes a Docker version of it.
